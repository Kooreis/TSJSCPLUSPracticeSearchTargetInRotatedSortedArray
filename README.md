# Question: How do you search for a target in a rotated sorted array? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `search` is designed to find a target number within a rotated sorted array. It uses a binary search algorithm, which is an efficient method for finding an item in a sorted list. The function begins by defining the start and end points of the search range, which initially encompass the entire array. It then enters a loop, which continues until the search range is exhausted. Within the loop, the function calculates the midpoint of the current search range. If the target number is found at the midpoint, the function returns the index of the midpoint. If the target number is not found, the function adjusts the search range based on whether the target number is greater or less than the number at the midpoint, and whether the array is sorted or rotated at the midpoint. This process continues until the target number is found or the search range is exhausted. If the search range is exhausted without finding the target number, the function returns -1. This function provides an efficient solution to the problem of finding a target number in a rotated sorted array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions use the same binary search algorithm to solve the problem. The main difference is that the TypeScript version is written in a class-based format, while the JavaScript version is written in a function-based format.

In the TypeScript version, the `search` method is defined as a static method inside the `RotatedArraySearch` class. This means that the method can be called directly on the class without creating an instance of the class. In contrast, the JavaScript version defines `search` as a standalone function.

Another difference is that the TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the types of the parameters and the return type of the `search` method. This provides additional type safety and can help catch potential type-related errors at compile time. The JavaScript version does not have this feature because JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language.

The calculation of the `mid` variable is slightly different in the two versions, but this does not affect the overall logic of the algorithm. Both versions calculate the middle index of the current search range, but the TypeScript version does it in a way that avoids potential overflow.

In conclusion, the TypeScript version provides additional type safety and uses a class-based format, while the JavaScript version uses a function-based format. Both versions use the same binary search algorithm to solve the problem.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses the same binary search algorithm as the JavaScript version to solve the problem. The main difference between the two versions is the language syntax and the way they handle arrays.

In the JavaScript version, arrays are built-in objects that can be manipulated directly. In the C++ version, arrays are handled using the vector class from the Standard Template Library (STL). The vector class provides dynamic arrays, which can be resized and have elements inserted or removed from them.

In terms of the binary search algorithm, both versions are almost identical. They both start by defining two pointers, start (or left) and end (or right), and then enter a while loop that continues until start is greater than end. Inside the loop, they calculate the mid index and check if the element at this index is the target. If it is, they return the mid index. If it's not, they adjust the start and end pointers based on whether the target is less than or greater than the mid element.

One minor difference in the calculation of the mid index is that the JavaScript version uses the Math.floor function to ensure that the result is an integer, while the C++ version uses integer division, which automatically discards the fractional part.

Another difference is in the output. The JavaScript version simply logs the result to the console, while the C++ version prints a message to the console indicating whether the element was found and at what index.
